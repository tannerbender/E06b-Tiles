Playing with the Tiled Map Editor
Within this file there is a little game that we can play once we run the python file. It is a small 2D tile game where we can hurdle and collect coins as we go. In order to do this we had to have a map.tmx file and we had to have a tile editor that we can transport. As you collect the coins your score will go up. There isn't really an ending.
